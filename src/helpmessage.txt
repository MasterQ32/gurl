This tool fetches gemini resources from gemspace.
The <url> must have the scheme gemini://.

-h, --help                 - Prints this help text
-o, --output <file>        - Saves the requested file into <file> instead of
                             writing it to stdout.
-O, --remote-name          - Similar to --output, but will use the file name
                             specified in the URL. Note that this option will
                             override a file name set with --output!
-t, --trust <level>        - Sets the trust level for certifactes. Allowed
                             values are:
                             all  - ignore the server certificate and just 
                             ca   - uses the trust anchor to verify the
                                    certificate
                             tofu - trust on first use. When a server is first
                                    time visited, its public key is stored in
                                    your trust store directory.
    --trust-anchor <cert>  - Uses <cert> (a PEM file) as your trust anchor for
                             certificate validation. The default value is
                             "/etc/ssl/cert.pem".
    --trust-store <path>   - Changes the folder which is used as a trust store
                             for known hosts. This path defaults to either
                             "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gurl/trust-store" or
                             "~/.config/gurl/trust-store", depending whether 
                             $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set or not.
-a, --accept-host          - Stores the hosts public key into the trust store
                             to be used with TOFU. The key will be later used
                             to authenticate the host as a "known host".
    --force-binary-on-stdout
                           - Will output to stdout, even if the mime type does
                             not start with "text/".
